						<h1>Risk Assessment of Digitalisation in Traditional Enterprises</h1>
					</header>

					<!-- Context Blockquote -->
					<blockquote>
						<p>The article by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019), titled Risks of Digitalisation of Business
							Models, addresses the risks inherent in the digitalisation of business models within the
							context of Industry 4.0. This is presented as a revolution rapidly transforming business
							models through the
							integration of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence
							(AI), Big Data, and Cloud Computing. While these technologies accelerate organisational
							transformations, they also introduce specific new risks related to the digitalisation of
							business models.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns Layout -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: Types of Identified Risks -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Types of Identified Risks</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Technical Risks:</strong> Relating to acquiring new skills and resources
									necessary for integrating technologies like IoT or Cloud Computing.</li>
								<li><strong>Competency Risks:</strong> Linked to the lack of skills among employees and
									the rapid adaptation to digitalisation processes.</li>
								<li><strong>Behavioural Risks:</strong> Involving user behaviours regarding digital
									solutions, particularly risks of excessive or inappropriate use.</li>
								<li><strong>Data Security Risks:</strong> Pertaining to data loss, cyberattacks, and
									security breaches.</li>
								<li><strong>Financial Risks:</strong> Significant investments and managing hidden costs
									associated with new technologies.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Risk Research and Assessment Methodology -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Risk Research and Assessment Methodology (FARE Method)</h2>
							<p>The authors use the FARE (Factor Relationship) method, a multi-criteria decision support
								approach. It helps evaluate the impact of various risks on the blocks of Osterwalder’s
								Business Model Canvas, including key partners, key activities, key resources, value
								proposition, customer relationships, distribution channels, customer segments, revenue
								streams, and cost structure. The expert evaluations are consolidated into a RADi (Risk
								Assessment of Digitalisation) matrix, which identifies the business model elements most
								affected by digitalisation risks.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- Key Risk Assessment Results Box -->
					<div class="box">
						<h2>Key Risk Assessment Results</h2>
						<p>The results indicate that distribution channels, key resources, and customer segments are the
							most vulnerable to digitalisation risks, while key partners are less affected. Competency
							and data security risks have a more significant impact than others on specific business
							model blocks.</p>
					</div>

					<!-- New Two Columns for Practical Recommendations and Implications for Research -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: Practical Recommendations -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Practical Recommendations</h2>
							<p>The authors suggest using the RADi matrix to support decision-making during the
								digitalisation of
								business models, helping anticipate risks and develop appropriate mitigation measures.
								The FARE
								method also allows for prioritising corrective actions based on the relationships
								between risk
								criteria.</p>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Implications for Research and Policy -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Implications for Research and Policy</h2>
							<p>The article points out gaps in the literature concerning the macro-level risk assessment
								of
								digitalisation. It recommends future research to expand the RADi matrix and consider the
								social
								implications of Industry 5.0, which includes the societal effects of technological
								disruptions.
