						<div class="column">
							<h3>1. Vendor Lock-In Issues (Opara-Martins et al., 2014)</h3>
							<p><strong>Key Problems Identified:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Data and format compatibility: Data or applications developed for a particular cloud
									provider may not be compatible with other platforms, making migration difficult.
								</li>
								<li>Proprietary features and closed APIs: The use of proprietary APIs restricts
									migration options by locking users into specific architectures.</li>
								<li>High migration costs: The financial and operational costs of transferring data,
									applications, and systems to another provider can be prohibitive.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Mitigating Vendor Lock-In:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Adopting open standards: Using open APIs and interoperable data standards is crucial
									to ensure systems can be easily migrated to another provider.</li>
								<li>Using multi-cloud solutions: Distributing resources across multiple cloud providers
									reduces dependency on a single provider and mitigates risks related to a provider's
									failure or abusive practices.</li>
								<li>Flexible contractual clauses: Negotiating contracts with easy exit mechanisms or
									conditions for data transfer without excessive fees can reduce the impact of
									lock-in.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div class="column">
							<h3>2. Security Issues in Modern Cloud Solutions (Morrow et al., 2021)</h3>
							<p><strong>Key Security Issues:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Data privacy: Storing sensitive data in the cloud can lead to risks of privacy
									breaches.</li>
								<li>Identity and access management (IAM): Poor access rights management can expose
									critical data to unauthorized users.</li>
								<li>API security: Vulnerable APIs can serve as entry points for cyberattacks.</li>
								<li>Lack of visibility and control: In a cloud environment, companies often lose direct
									control over their infrastructure, complicating security monitoring.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Mitigating Security Issues:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Data encryption: Using encryption for data at rest and in transit ensures that
									sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.</li>
								<li>Strict IAM policies: Implementing strict identity and access management policies
									ensures that only authorized users can access critical data and systems.</li>
								<li>Continuous auditing and monitoring: Cloud systems must be continuously monitored and
									audited to identify suspicious or abnormal activities.</li>
								<li>Utilizing native cloud security tools: Cloud providers offer integrated security
									solutions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and vulnerability
									management solutions.</li>

								<h3>Scenario 1: RPO = 1 hour; RTO = 8 hours; High Availability Required</h3>
							</header>
							<p><strong>Solution Description:</strong> Mirrored infrastructure with automatic failover:
								Redundant servers distributed across multiple data centers. If the primary server fails,
								the system automatically switches to the secondary server.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Synchronous data replication: Real-time replication between the primary and
									secondary sites ensures a maximum data loss of 1 hour.</li>
								<li>Hourly backups: Backups are performed every hour to an offsite storage, ensuring
									data is always up-to-date.</li>
								<li>Real-time monitoring: A monitoring system is in place to detect any server failure
									and trigger failover when necessary.</li>
							</ul>

						</div>

				</section>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The Primary Data Center contains two application servers (App Server 1 and App Server
						2) connected to a shared database (Database 1). These servers are behind a load
						balancer that manages traffic and directs users to the available servers. The
						monitoring system continuously checks the status of the applications and database to
						ensure availability.
						The Secondary Data Center acts as a failover site. It includes two backup servers
						(Failover App Server 1 and 2) with a replicated database (Failover Database).
						Synchronous replication ensures real-time updates between the primary and secondary
						databases. In case of failure in the primary site, the load balancer automatically
						switches traffic to the secondary servers.
						Hourly backups are performed to an offsite storage system for additional recovery
						options in case of a disaster that affects both data centers.</p>

								<h3>Scenario 2: RPO = 24 hours; RTO = 72 hours; HA Not Required</h3>
							</header>
							<p><strong>Solution Description:</strong> Daily backups with asynchronous replication: Data
								is backed up once per day, allowing a maximum data loss of 24 hours.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Offsite storage: Backups are stored in a remote cloud or physical site, ensuring
									secure long-term storage.</li>
								<li>Manual restoration: Since high availability is not required, system restoration can
									be done manually within 72 hours, providing ample time for recovery.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
				</section>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The Primary Data Center houses two application servers (App Server 1 and App Server 2) that
						connect to a main database (Database 1). The data is asynchronously replicated to a Backup
						Database at a secondary site, meaning that data is not immediately synchronized, but backed up
						periodically.
						A Backup Server performs daily backups to an Offsite Storage system, providing a secure location
						for long-term data storage. In the event of a disaster, these backups are used to restore the
						system, though the process is manual.
						The Backup Site has its own application servers that can be brought online within 72 hours if
						needed. These backup servers are not always active, allowing for a slower restoration process
						when high availability is not required.</p>

								<h3>Scenario 3: RPO = 5 minutes; RTO = 1 hour; High Availability Required</h3>
							</header>
							<p><strong>Solution Description:</strong> Continuous replication with automatic failover:
								Data is replicated almost in real-time, ensuring a maximum data loss of 5 minutes.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Virtualized critical systems: Critical systems are virtualized to allow rapid
									recovery and deployment, ensuring that services can be restored in under an hour.
								</li>
								<li>Hybrid cloud architecture: A hybrid cloud setup uses both private and public clouds.
									The private cloud handles critical applications, while the public cloud manages less
									sensitive data, providing flexibility and high availability.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
				</section>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The Private Cloud houses critical application servers (Critical App Server 1 and 2) connected to
						a Critical Database. These systems are virtualized to allow for fast recovery and scaling. The
						critical data is continuously replicated to the Public Cloud.
						The Public Cloud handles less critical applications (Non-Critical App Server 1 and 2) and stores
						the Non-Critical Database. The public cloud is also virtualized, allowing it to handle the
						overflow in case of a disaster in the private cloud.
						Data is replicated in near-real-time between the critical and non-critical databases, ensuring
						that data loss is minimized to 5 minutes. Backups are taken every 5 minutes to an offsite secure
						storage, providing additional layers of data protection.
						In case of a failure, the system automatically switches to the Public Cloud for recovery,
						ensuring that services are restored within an hour.
