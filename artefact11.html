						<h1>Digital and operational risks Assessment for Pampered Pets</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Pampered Pets, a company specializing in high-quality pet food, is undergoing a major digital
						transformation, which includes establishing an international supply chain and automating
						warehouses globally. These changes, funded by Orla O'dour, have raised concerns from two major
						clients (HRH the King and Prince Albert II of Monaco) regarding product quality and supply chain
						security.

						The company has chosen a multi-cloud solution (AWS, Azure, GCP) to ensure resilience,
						scalability, and rapid disaster recovery in case of incidents.</p>

						<p>The key risks include::</p>
						<li> <strong>Product quality loss</strong> (€20,000 | 30%)</li>
						<li> <strong>Automated system failures</strong> (€50,000 per day of downtime | 15%)</li>
						<li> <strong>Supply chain delays</strong> (€15,000 per month | 20%)</li>
					</div>
					<!-- Section 2: Recommendations -->
					<h2>Recommendations</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<li><strong>Outsourcing cybersecurity and critical infrastructure management:</strong> This
							would allow Pampered Pets to benefit from specialized expertise while ensuring regulatory
							compliance. <a href="images\appendix1.pdf" target="_blank"> <strong> Click here to view the
									Appendix 1 _
									Analysis
									of
									Applicable Standards for Pampered Pets</strong></a></li>
						<blockquote>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>GDPR:</strong> Protection of personal data through regular audits, clear
									privacy
									policies, and encryption of sensitive data.</li>
								<li><strong>ISO/IEC 27001:</strong> Implementation of an Information Security Management
									System (ISMS), strict management of access to critical information, and regular
									testing
									to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
								<li><strong>ISO 22301:</strong> Establishment of a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) with a
									disaster recovery strategy for critical systems, ensuring that Pampered Pets can
									continue operations in the event of a major disruption.</li>
								<li><strong>PCI DSS:</strong> Securing online credit card transactions with encryption
									systems and regular monitoring of transactions to ensure their integrity.</li>
								<li><strong>ISO 9001:</strong> Implementation of a Quality Management System (QMS),
									conducting regular quality audits, and ensuring continuous improvement of production
									processes.</li>
								<li><strong>ISO 28000:</strong> Management of logistical risks through the integration
									of
									buffer stocks, monitoring supplier performance, and implementing a risk management
									plan.
								</li>
								<li><strong>NIS2:</strong> Strengthening cybersecurity for critical infrastructures with
									incident management protocols and regular communication with competent authorities
									in
									the event of a cyberattack.</li>
							</ul>
						</blockquote>

						<li><strong>Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy:</strong>
							Establish a plan to ensure operational continuity in the event of a disaster, including
							real-time monitoring and redundancy processes for critical systems.</li>
						<li><strong>Proactive management of quality and supply chain:</strong>
							Diversify suppliers and establish buffer stocks to reduce the impact of delays.</li>

					<!-- Section 3: Multiplateform -->
					<h2>Multi-Cloud Architecture</h2>
					<p>Pampered Pets is adopting a robust multi-cloud architecture to ensure both Business Continuity
						(BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR). This architecture, leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS),
						Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), distributes critical workloads across multiple
						platforms, minimizing the risk of failure and ensuring rapid recovery in the event of an
						incident.</p>
					<h3>AWS – Managing Critical Systems and DR

					</h3>
					<p>AWS is used to manage critical systems, including warehouse automation and online transaction
						processing. Key AWS services include:
					</p>
					<span class="image"><img src="images/aws.png" alt="" style="width:70%;" /></span>
					<h3>Azure – Managing Supply Chain and BC

					</h3>
					<p>Microsoft Azure is responsible for managing the supply chain and stock, with a focus on business
						continuity:
					</p>
					<span class="image"><img src="images/azure.png" alt="" style="width:70%;" /></span>
					<h3>GCP – Network Performance Optimization and DR

					</h3>
					<p>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is used to optimize network performance and ensure data replication
						globally:
					</p>
					<span class="image"><img src="images/gcp.png" alt="" style="width:70%;" /></span>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<li>AWS ensures critical systems remain accessible
								even during major outages. Continuous monitoring and data replication ensure RTO
								(Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) remain below one minute,
								minimizing disruptions.
							</li>
							<li>Azure ensures that supply chain management remains
								efficient and that stock is available even during significant outages. Through
								monitoring tools and redundancy, Azure ensures business operations can continue without
								significant disruption.
							</li>
							<li>GCP ensures that critical data is continuously
								replicated across multiple regions. System redundancy and optimized network management
								guarantee fast recovery in case of a disaster, without compromising service quality.
							</li>
						</p>
					</blockquote>


					<!-- Section 4: DR BC -->
					<h2>Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy
					</h2>
					<div class="box">
						<p>The combination of AWS, Azure, and GCP creates a resilient multi-cloud architecture that
							addresses BC and DR needs:</p>
						<li><strong>High availability:</strong> Redundancy of critical systems and data replication
							across
							multiple regions ensure services remain available even if one provider experiences downtime.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Rapid recovery: </strong> Real-time monitoring systems such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure
							Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations automatically trigger failovers to other platforms in
							case
							of failure. This enables extremely short RPO and RTO (less than one minute).
						</li>
						<li><strong>Flexibility and reduction of vendor lock-in:</strong> Open technologies like
							Kubernetes
							for container orchestration allow applications to be deployed on any platform, reducing
							dependency on a single provider. This ensures greater flexibility in case of a provider
							change.
						</li>
					</div>
					<blockquote>
						<h3>Automatic Failover and Data Recovery
						</h3>
						<p>In the event of a failure, automatic failover mechanisms redirect critical services to
							available platforms:</p>
						<li>AWS Elastic Load Balancer, Azure Traffic Manager, and Google Cloud Load Balancer ensure
							traffic
							distribution, preventing service interruption
						</li>
						<li>Data replication across platforms guarantees quick recovery, enabling systems to return to
							their
							initial state once the failure is resolved (<strong>failback</strong>).
						</li>
