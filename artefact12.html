						<h1>The Future of SRM: Resilience to Emerging Threats</h1>

					</header>
					<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To demonstrate why resilience will be the most influential trend
						in security risk management (SRM) over the next five years, focusing on service continuity
						and protection against inevitable and sophisticated threats.</p>
					<!-- Context Section -->
					<h2>Context of Emerging Threats</h2>
					<div class="columns">
						<div class="column">
							<h3>AI and IoT</h3>
							<p>Threats related to AI include the manipulation of learning data and adversarial attacks,
								where AI models can be deceived. Autonomous systems such as self-driving cars are
								vulnerable to hacking, which could lead to serious accidents.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column">
							<h3>Increased Complexity and New Vulnerabilities</h3>
							<p>Modern information systems are increasingly complex, making it harder to secure each
								component. The expansion of IoT multiplies entry points for cyberattacks, with the
								growing number of connected devices (sensors, smart objects) posing challenges for
								uniform security standards.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- Why Resilience is Key Section -->
					<h2>Why Resilience is Key</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Resilience is the ability of a system to continue functioning and providing its essential
							services, even when some of its components are compromised or attacked. This includes fault
							tolerance, redundancy, and quick recovery from attacks.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<div class="columns">
						<div class="column">
							<h3>Growing Importance</h3>
							<p>It has become unrealistic to believe that all cyberattacks can be prevented. The
								challenge is ensuring continuity of service even when an attack is successful. Critical
								infrastructures, such as electrical grids and healthcare systems, require resilience to
								avoid catastrophic consequences.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column">
							<h3>Concrete Example</h3>
							<p>During the WannaCry ransomware attack, some critical infrastructures, such as hospitals,
								were able to continue functioning thanks to redundant systems and business continuity
								plans. This kind of preparation is essential in an environment where cyberattacks are
								becoming increasingly sophisticated.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- Frameworks and Strategies Section -->
					<h2>Frameworks and Strategies to Strengthen Resilience</h2>
					<div class="columns">
						<div class="column">
							<h3>Recommended Approaches</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Scalability and composability:</strong> Secure systems must scale without
									constant reevaluation of each component.</li>
								<li><strong>Diversification of components:</strong> Using different software or hardware
									platforms ensures that even if part of the system fails, others will continue to
									operate.</li>
								<li><strong>Predictive modeling:</strong> Models based on security metrics allow better
									prediction of vulnerabilities and anticipation of attacks.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="column">
							<h3>Existing Frameworks</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>NIST Framework:</strong> Particularly suited for critical infrastructures
									with recommendations on system resilience.</li>
								<li><strong>ISO/IEC 27005:</strong> Manages risks while integrating business continuity
									strategies, ensuring essential services are maintained during incidents.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- Legal and Ethical Issues Section -->
					<h2>Legal, Social, and Ethical Issues</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Compliance and regulation are essential in resilience strategies. Organizations must comply
							with
							regulations such as
							GDPR, while ethical responsibility arises when AI decisions lead to harmful outcomes, such
							as accidents caused by autonomous systems.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Conclusion and Call to Action -->
					<h2>Conclusion and Call to Action</h2>
					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Resilience will be the most influential trend in SRM over the next
							five years. Organizations must invest now to ensure their critical systems can withstand
							increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.</p>
						<p><strong>Call to Action:</strong> Governments and organizations should invest in research and
							technologies to guarantee better resilience and protect critical infrastructures long-term.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- FAQ Section -->
					<h2>FAQ â€“ Resilience and Security Risk Management</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>1. How is resilience different from prevention or intrusion detection?</strong>
							Resilience ensures critical systems continue to operate even after successful attacks,
							unlike prevention (which stops attacks) or detection (which identifies them).</li>
						<li><strong>2. Recent examples where resilient architecture minimized cyberattack
								impact?</strong> During WannaCry, hospitals continued operations thanks to resilient
							systems. In the energy sector, some infrastructures resisted attacks with resilience
							mechanisms.</li>
						<li><strong>3. What tools or techniques improve resilience?</strong> Network segmentation,
							redundant systems, and hybrid cloud services, along with machine learning-based anomaly
							detection tools, enhance resilience.</li>
						<li><strong>4. Role of human behavior in system resilience?</strong> Continuous training and
							automated processes like multi-factor authentication help minimize vulnerabilities due to
							human error.</li>
						<li><strong>5. Legal and ethical challenges in resilience?</strong> GDPR compliance and data
							protection, as well as AI decision accountability, are central to resilience.</li>
						<li><strong>6. Is resilience only about technology?</strong> No, it also involves organizational
							aspects like human resource management, business continuity planning, and corporate culture.
						</li>
						<li><strong>7. In which industries is resilience most critical?</strong> Critical
							infrastructures (energy, healthcare, transport) and financial services will need the most
							resilience in the coming years.</li>
						<li><strong>8. How do frameworks like NIST or ISO/IEC contribute to resilience?</strong> NIST
							offers guidelines for integrating resilience strategies into infrastructures. ISO/IEC 27005
							ensures business continuity during incidents.</li>
						<li><strong>9. Why is resilience more influential than traditional cybersecurity?</strong> In an
							environment where attacks are inevitable, resilience ensures operational continuity and
							rapid recovery after attacks.</li>
