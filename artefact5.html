					<!-- FAQ Section -->
					<div class="faq">
						<h2>FAQ</h2>
						<div class="columns">
							<div class="column">
								<h3>1. What is the importance of ISO/IEC 27001 for an international bank?</h3>
								<p>ISO/IEC 27001 provides a framework for managing information security within an
									organization. For an international bank, this standard is crucial to protect
									sensitive client data, such as banking information and financial transactions. It
									also ensures business continuity in case of a cyberattack or security incident.
									ISO/IEC 27001 requires the bank to continuously identify, evaluate, and address
									risks related to information security.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="column">
								<h3>2. How does the HIPAA framework protect patient data in a hospital?</h3>
								<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) enforces strict rules
									to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information. It sets
									standards for accessing medical records, sharing them with third parties, and
									protecting against data breaches. Hospitals must ensure that all communications and
									records are properly secured, that access is restricted to authorized personnel, and
									that any data breach is reported in accordance with the law.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="columns">
							<div class="column">
								<h3>3. What types of security tests are recommended for a large food manufacturing
									plant?</h3>
								<p>Several security tests are recommended, including:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities in connected systems, particularly
										the IIoT systems used for automation.</li>
									<li>ISO 22000 compliance audits to ensure food safety practices are followed.</li>
									<li>Security audits of information systems to verify that critical production data
										and processes are protected from intrusion or tampering.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="column">
								<h3>4. Why should a hospital adopt ISO 27799 in addition to ISO/IEC 27001?</h3>
								<p>ISO 27799 is a standard specific to protecting healthcare data, based on the
									principles of ISO/IEC 27001. It provides detailed recommendations for protecting
									personal health information, which is considered sensitive data. By adopting ISO
									27799, a hospital can ensure that its management of health records adheres to
									security practices specific to the healthcare sector, in addition to the general
									guidelines of ISO/IEC 27001 for information security.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="columns">
							<div class="column">
								<h3>5. What are the best practices for aligning COBIT with an international bank’s
									objectives?</h3>
								<p>COBIT is an IT governance framework that helps align IT objectives with the company’s
									strategic goals. Best practices for an international bank include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Using COBIT to establish a regular audit process and ensure that IT resources
										support profitability, regulatory compliance, and risk management objectives.
									</li>
									<li>Integrating COBIT to manage IT risks by identifying potential threats and
										implementing controls to mitigate them.</li>
									<li>Ensuring that data governance follows clear processes aligned with the legal and
										security requirements of international banking transactions.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="column">
								<h3>6. What are the challenges of implementing PCI DSS in a bank?</h3>
								<p>Implementing PCI DSS in a bank presents several challenges, such as:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Continuous compliance: Banks must ensure that payment processing systems are
										constantly PCI DSS compliant, which involves regular software updates and
										security audits.</li>
									<li>Protecting credit card data: Encryption, firewalls, and access management are
										critical measures to protect card information.</li>
									<li>Monitoring and detection: Banks need to implement monitoring systems to detect
										any suspicious activity in transactions and quickly report any anomalies.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="columns">
							<div class="column">
								<h3>7. How does ISO 9001 help a food manufacturing plant improve quality?</h3>
								<p>ISO 9001 is a quality management standard that helps companies, including food
									manufacturing plants, establish effective, controlled processes to ensure that
									produced goods meet quality and safety requirements. It mandates regular audits,
									process reviews, and the establishment of KPIs (key performance indicators) to track
									continuous improvement. For a food manufacturing plant, this results in better
									traceability, reduced waste, and compliance with food safety standards such as ISO
									22000.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="column">
								<h3>8. What access management tools are recommended for an international bank?</h3>
								<p>Recommended access management tools include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>IAM (Identity and Access Management):</strong> Manages and controls who
										has access to which data in the bank, allowing specific roles and permissions to
										be assigned to each employee.</li>
									<li><strong>MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):</strong> Adds an extra layer of
										security by requiring a second form of authentication, such as a security code
										sent to a mobile device, in addition to a password.</li>
									<li><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO):</strong> Reduces risks by centralizing
										authentication, allowing access to multiple systems with one secure login
										session.</li>
								</ul>
