						<h1>Prosecution of Private Investigators</h1>
					</header>

					<!-- Background -->
					<div>
						<h2>Background</h2>
						<p>M.C.K. Rentals Limited, a private investigation firm, was prosecuted in 2014 for illegally
							accessing personal data held by public institutions, such as the Department of Social
							Protection and the Primary Care Reimbursement Service of the Health Service Executive. These
							data were then provided to credit unions to track down individuals who had defaulted on loan
							repayments.</p>
					</div>

					<!-- GDPR Violations -->
					<div class="box">
						<h2>GDPR Violations</h2>
						<p>The company violated the Data Protection Acts of 1988 and 2003, primarily by accessing
							personal data without the data controller's authorization (Article 22) and disclosing this
							information to third parties (Article 29).</p>
					</div>

					<!-- Details of the Conviction -->
					<div>
						<h2>Details of the Conviction</h2>
						<p>At the hearing on October 6, 2014, at Bray District Court, M.C.K. Rentals Limited pleaded
							guilty to five of the twenty-three counts of accessing personal data without authorization.
							The company was fined €1,500 per offense, totaling €7,500 for the five offenses. The two
							directors, Margaret Stuart and Wendy Martin, were also fined €1,500 each for their
							involvement in the violations.</p>
					</div>

					<!-- Implemented Measures and Why They Are Important -->
					<h2>Implemented Measures and Why They Are Important</h2>
					<div class="columns">
						<div class="column">
							<h3>1. Auditing Access to Personal Data</h3>
							<p>The goal of auditing access is to ensure that personal data is only accessible to
								authorized personnel and that any abnormal activity is detected and addressed.</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p><strong>How?</strong> Implement logging systems that record every attempt to access
									data, including user details, time, and type of access. Tools like SIEM and ACLs can
									monitor and control access to sensitive data.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Monitoring Tools:</strong> SIEM systems for real-time monitoring of access.
								</li>
								<li><strong>ACL:</strong> Define access based on roles and permissions to minimize
									unnecessary access.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div class="column">
							<h3>2. Training: Employee Awareness and Responsibility</h3>
							<p>Training employees is essential to raise awareness of data protection risks and ensure
								responsibility for data usage.</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p><strong>Why?</strong> Human errors often cause data breaches. Training helps
									employees recognize risks like phishing or social engineering attacks.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<ul>
								<li>Organize mandatory training sessions on handling personal data securely.</li>
								<li>Test awareness through phishing simulations.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="columns">
						<div class="column">
							<h3>3. Strict Data Sharing Policies with Third Parties</h3>
							<p>Data sharing policies establish procedures for sharing personal data with third parties.
								A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) should be signed to ensure GDPR compliance.</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p><strong>Example:</strong> Limit data access to necessary information, and require
									authorization from a manager for every request.</p>
							</blockquote>
						</div>

						<div class="column">
							<h3>4. Enhanced Security Mechanisms</h3>
							<p>Security mechanisms such as encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Data Loss
								Prevention (DLP) are essential to protect personal data from unauthorized access and
								breaches.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encrypt personal data in storage and in transit.</li>
								<li><strong>MFA:</strong> Add an extra layer of authentication for sensitive data
									access.</li>
								<li><strong>DLP:</strong> Monitor data transfers and block unauthorized copying.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- Conclusion -->
					<div class="box">
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>These measures help ensure GDPR compliance and protect personal data from misuse or breaches.
							The M.C.K. Rentals Limited case illustrates how poor data management practices can result in
							severe penalties. It is crucial for organizations to implement strong security measures and
							policies to avoid similar outcomes.</p>
