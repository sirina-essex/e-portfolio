						<h2>Peer Response 1</h2>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Thank you Stephanie for your contribution.</p>
							<p>Your initial post effectively covers different aspects of Industry 4.0 and presents a
								well-structured and comprehensive overview, with clear examples and a balanced
								discussion of its benefits and risks.</p>
							<p>However, I would like to pay particular attention to the point concerning the predictive
								maintenance risks. “Selecting a suitable maintenance strategy became imperative because
								process plants are being gutted by recurrent accidents often triggered by poor
								maintenance management” (Okoh, 2015 cited in Abassi et al., 2022). Today, effective and
								intelligent CBM systems are expected to detect early forms of degradation, so
								maintenance costs caused by inaccurate or poor maintenance scheduling can get reduced
								(Hashemian, 2010).</p>
							<p>Also, as you mentioned in your initial post, according to Sivarajah et al. (2017),
								effective data management is crucial in the digital era, as the inability to properly
								handle, store, and analyse large datasets can undermine the benefits of digital
								transformation and expose organizations to regulatory risks and operational
								inefficiencies.</p>
							<p>Alongside the risks associated with data volumes, it is also worth highlighting the
								importance of data protection. "The permanent physical loss of key information could
								have a serious negative impact on a business. Data protection is therefore a cornerstone
								of any organization's risk management, and risk management is now recognized as one of
								the fundamental tasks of any business." (Hill, 2016)</p>

						<h2>Peer Response by Tutor: Doug Millward</h2>
						<blockquote>

							<p>Hi Stephanie and Nelson, once again some excellent points were made in these posts. I
								particularly like Stephanie's points about the risks of automated/AI-based maintenance
								predictions and the risks of data management. As she points out (and Industry 4.0
								agrees, but downplays somewhat) AI and automation in general are not good enough at the
								moment to rely on in critical situations - such as those encapsulated by poor
								maintenance or even worse poor checks of pharmaceutical data.</p>
							<p>I think the calculation should always be where human lives are at stake a human should be
								in the loop (although businesses may be more driven by the larger impacts of
								reputational damage - the same point applies). What do you think - should there be more
								focus on keeping humans in the loop of critical processes?</p>

						<h2>Peer Response 3</h2>
						<blockquote>

							<p>Thank you, Stephanie, Nelson, and Doug. I have to agree wholeheartedly with Doug’s point
								of having a Human in the loop, especially when Human Health and Safety is involved.
								Perhaps because I have twelve years of experience performing Quality Control on Medical
								Devices and Software as Medical Devices (SMD), I often think “who QC’s the QC robot?”
							</p>
							<p>In the world of Medical Physics and the use of Machine Learning and AI for Healthcare,
								guidelines are in place to ensure that the Machine output is accurate and is routinely
								checked (Claessens et al., 2022; Fujii et al., 2020). A recent report by the American
								Association of Physicists in Medicine – Task Group 273 (Hadjiiski et al., 2023), goes
								into great depth on the use of AI in healthcare, emphasizing the importance of good
								quality training data, and regular quality checks of the output. In fact, they only
								refer to “Computer aided decision support” implying one should not rely solely on AI
								output.</p>
							<p>I am interested in your suggestion that a SME utilise a strategic partnership to help
								realise the benefits of Industry 4.0. What do you think the barriers to a SME engaging
								with a strategic partner might be, and do you think that the benefits of such a
								partnership outweigh the cost? I have personally struggled with securing funding for
								such partnerships, and have only succeeded when I have been able to demonstrate we can
								share or transfer any risk from my organisation.</p>
