							<p><strong>Hi Irina,</strong></p>
							<p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts about CVSS.</p>
							<p>While the latest version of CVSS was recently published and offers significant
								improvements over its predecessor, the system still fails to address important aspects
								such as inadequate representation of real-world risk and limited scope and lack of
								context, which includes the potential for chained exploits (Divinsky, 2023).</p>
							<p>I would argue that the chaining of different vulnerabilities is an easy-to-understand
								topic, and neither is the modeling of such threats. Robinson (2022) concluded in her
								paper titled “An Exploratory Study into Vulnerability Chaining Blindness Terminology and
								Viability” that IT and cybersecurity professionals often lack awareness of vulnerability
								chaining, a term that refers to the potential compounding effects of multiple
								vulnerabilities. Although cybersecurity professionals acknowledge its importance, the
								term is not well-understood or widely used across the board, especially within IT
								operations teams.</p>
							<p>There is a gap between IT and cybersecurity professionals. While both groups recognize
								the need for holistic, risk-based management of security, IT professionals are more
								concerned with system functionality and user needs, rather than focusing on the broader
								implications of lower-priority vulnerabilities that could be exploited in combination.
								On the other hand, cybersecurity professionals see the value in addressing these
								vulnerabilities but struggle with the complexity and sheer volume of information
								required to implement defense in depth effectively.</p>

						<h2>Peer Response 2</h2>

							<p><strong>Thank you Irina for sharing your thoughts.</strong></p>
							<p>The criticisms of CVSS by Spring et al. (2021) highlight significant shortcomings that
								undermine its effectiveness in assessing vulnerabilities. One major issue is the lack of
								empirical justification for its calculation formula, which raises questions about the
								reliability of the scores generated. In sensitive sectors such as healthcare, where
								system availability can be crucial, an incorrect assessment could have disastrous
								consequences (Chase and Coley, 2019). Equally weighting confidentiality, integrity, and
								availability axes does not take into account sector specificities. For example, a
								vulnerability that threatens availability can put lives at risk.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, CVSS assesses vulnerabilities in isolation, ignoring the risks associated
								with complex attacks that exploit multiple weaknesses in a chain. This approach is
								particularly problematic in interconnected systems, where vulnerabilities can interact
								in a non-linear manner, leading to overall impacts that are often underestimated (Farris
								et al., 2018).</p>
							<p>On the other hand, cyber risk quantification (CRQ) appears to be a more suitable method.
								It allows organizations to assess risks in financial terms, thus providing a better
								understanding of the economic impacts of each vulnerability. This contextualized
								approach, oriented towards the specific consequences of each sector, facilitates more
								informed strategic decision-making.</p>
							<p>In short, it is imperative to adopt assessment methodologies that consider the
								operational context to improve risk management in critical environments, where precision
								is essential.</p>
