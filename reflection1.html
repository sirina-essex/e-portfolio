						<h1>Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h1>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I deepened my understanding of the fundamental definitions and concepts related to security
							and risk management, drawing from various disciplines and approaches. This has laid the
							essential groundwork for evaluating risks in different contexts in a rigorous manner.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Review of common definitions of security and risk management:</strong> The
									unit allowed me to explore a variety of definitions from different disciplines. I
									now have a more nuanced understanding of how differences in interpreting the term
									"risk" can influence risk management. This is crucial to avoid misapplying processes
									in risk management.</li>
								<li><strong>Concepts of qualitative and quantitative risks:</strong> The distinction
									between qualitative and quantitative approaches to risk is now much clearer to me. I
									understand in which contexts each of these approaches is appropriate and how to use
									them depending on the data available.</li>
								<li><strong>Risk management process:</strong> I gained an in-depth understanding of the
									process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and mitigating risks. Frameworks such
									as SP 800-30 and ISO 31000 provide guidelines that I can now apply to effectively
									structure risk management.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Understanding risk definitions:</strong> I learned that how risk is
									understood and measured can influence management strategies. This key point will be
									essential in my future analyses.</li>
								<li><strong>Ability to evaluate, qualify, and mitigate risks:</strong> Although the unit
									only introduces this process, I now understand how these steps must be integrated
									into a security management framework.</li>
								<li><strong>Approaches to quantify and qualify risks:</strong> I now better grasp the
									differences between qualitative and quantitative methods and have learned to adapt
									my analysis based on the data available. When precise data is lacking, I understand
									that qualitative assessment can play a crucial role.</li>
								<li><strong>Knowledge of security and risk management standards:</strong> I am now more
									familiar with key standards, such as ISO 31000 and ISO 27005, and I understand their
									importance in ensuring that risk management aligns with industry best practices.
								</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It has helped me consolidate my theoretical foundations in risk and security
							management, clarifying key concepts that I will explore further in future units. I enjoyed
							revisiting familiar concepts while being stimulated by new perspectives on risk evaluation
							methods.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>This led me to critically reflect on the differences in definitions and approaches and to
							adjust how I approach them. I also refined my understanding of the complementarity between
							qualitative and quantitative evaluations, which will allow me to adapt my analyses according
							to specific contexts. These insights are reflected in my ability to explain these concepts
							and apply them to industry standards, further enhancing my confidence in assessing and
							mitigating risks effectively.</p>
