						<h1>Practical Applications and Challenges of Disaster Recovery(DR)</h1>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I explored the practical aspects of designing and implementing disaster recovery (DR)
							solutions, considering critical elements such as Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery
							Time Objective (RTO), and high availability (HA). I gained a deeper understanding of how
							these factors influence the choice and design of DR solutions, especially in cloud-based
							environments.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Impact of RPO and RTO values on DR solutions:</strong> RPO and RTO are two
									fundamental concepts in disaster recovery planning. For example, a company with an
									RPO of 1 hour and an RTO of 8 hours would need mirrored backup infrastructure with
									frequent replications to minimize data loss and quickly restore systems.</li>
								<li><strong>Typical DR solutions and their limitations:</strong> We explored solutions
									ranging from manual backups to synchronous replication. Each solution has its
									limitations, particularly regarding cost and complexity.</li>
								<li><strong>Vendor lock-in issues and resilience:</strong> Vendor lock-in is a major
									challenge, particularly in cloud environments. Multi-cloud strategies and open
									standards can mitigate this risk and improve resilience.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Designing solutions based on RPO and RTO requirements:</strong> I learned
									how to tailor DR solutions to specific RPO/RTO needs. For instance, a 5-minute RPO
									and 1-hour RTO require synchronous replication with automatic failover.</li>
								<li><strong>Understanding DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service):</strong> DRaaS is a
									cost-effective solution, but companies must weigh data security and provider
									dependency. It's particularly useful for SMEs needing flexible recovery solutions.
								</li>
								<li><strong>Resilience and security in cloud environments:</strong> Cloud-based DR
									solutions require a layered security approach, including encryption and access
									management, to protect shared environments.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>The project of designing DR solutions highlighted the importance of balancing cost
							constraints with operational needs. It also gave me a deeper understanding of the complexity
							and rewarding challenge of designing tailored DR solutions for real-time replication and
							cloud-based infrastructures.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>Designing disaster recovery solutions is a critical step in ensuring organizational
							resilience, especially as cloud-based solutions like DRaaS grow in importance. However,
							implementation challenges remain, particularly when balancing cost, security, and
							performance requirements.</p>
