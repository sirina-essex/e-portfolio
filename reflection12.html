						<h1>The Great Debate
						</h1>
						<p>What Will Be the Most Influential Trend in SRM Over the Next 5 Years?
						</p>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Proposition to debate on the most influential trends in security risk management (SRM) over
							the next five years. Although I am not directly participating in the seminar, I conducted my
							own research on emerging trends and their potential impact.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Resilience as a key trend:</strong> One major trend is the resilience of
									critical systems. As cyber threats evolve, resilience—the ability to maintain
									essential functions despite attacks—has become indispensable. Case studies like the
									WannaCry attack show the importance of redundancy in ensuring service continuity.
								</li>
								<li><strong>Impact of AI and emerging technologies:</strong> AI and IoT bring new
									challenges, increasing the risk of adversarial attacks. AI enables real-time threat
									detection and automates responses, reducing reaction times to cyberattacks.</li>
								<li><strong>Service continuity and DR plans:</strong> I also analyzed strategies for
									service continuity in critical infrastructures. Ensuring operations continue during
									an attack requires redundant systems and disaster recovery (DR) scenarios tailored
									to businesses' needs.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Defending resilience as the most influential trend:</strong> Resilience will
									be crucial in SRM as cyber threats grow. Prevention is no longer sufficient, and
									systems must operate even after an attack.</li>
								<li><strong>Evaluating existing frameworks:</strong> Frameworks like NIST and ISO/IEC
									27005 are essential for implementing resilience strategies. They guide continuity
									and disaster recovery processes.</li>
								<li><strong>Analyzing social and ethical issues:</strong> The legal and ethical aspects
									of managing AI-based systems are increasingly relevant. Companies must balance
									technological innovation with privacy and security concerns.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>My research allowed me to understand the growing importance of resilience, especially in
							critical sectors like healthcare, energy, and financial services. While AI is transforming
							proactive cybersecurity, it also raises ethical and security challenges. Resilience and
							service continuity have become non-negotiable for businesses in an increasingly digital
							world.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>The debate surrounding future trends in SRM highlights the need for resilience in a world
							where cyberattacks are inevitable. The rapid growth of AI and IoT introduces both innovation
							and risk, making it crucial to develop robust strategies that can withstand these new
							challenges.</p>
