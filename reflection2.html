						<h1>Users, Evaluations, and the Risk Management Process</h1>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I delved deeper into the risk management process, focusing on the importance of different
							risk evaluation approaches (qualitative and quantitative) and highlighting the essential
							role of users in this process. This provided a clearer understanding of how user perceptions
							influence risk assessments and the implementation of mitigation measures.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Risk Management Process (RMP):</strong> The unit offered a detailed
									framework of the risk management process, explaining how the different stages, from
									risk identification to mitigation, need to be systematically implemented. I gained a
									better grasp of the RMP’s structure and its importance within an organization.</li>
								<li><strong>Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Evaluations:</strong> I deepened my
									understanding of these two primary evaluation methods. The qualitative approach
									captures users’ often subjective perceptions, while the quantitative approach allows
									for a more rigorous, data-driven analysis. I now understand the contexts in which
									each method is most appropriate.</li>
								<li><strong>User Participation:</strong> It highlighted the importance of
									involving users in the risk management process. Their participation not only
									improves the accuracy of risk assessments but also ensures better adherence to the
									proposed mitigation measures.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Understanding Evaluation Approaches:</strong> I now have a clearer view of
									the advantages and limitations of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
									This helped me better understand how to balance these two methods to gain a
									comprehensive view of risks in different contexts.</li>
								<li><strong>The Importance of User Participation:</strong> I learned that users play a
									central role in identifying risks and implementing solutions. Their involvement can
									help identify risks that may not be visible through a purely technical analysis.
								</li>
								<li><strong>Implementing Mitigation Measures:</strong> User involvement also has a
									direct impact on the effectiveness of mitigation solutions. I understood that their
									engagement not only enhances the accuracy of risk assessments but also facilitates
									the acceptance of the measures put in place.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It allowed me to solidify my understanding of different risk evaluation approaches and
							the crucial role of users in the risk management process. I particularly appreciated how the
							interaction between qualitative and quantitative evaluations can offer a more nuanced view
							of risks.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>It prompted me to think more deeply about the importance of not underestimating user
							feedback, which can reveal vulnerabilities often invisible in purely technical analyses.
							It also reinforced my belief that user involvement should not be seen as just an
							asset but as an essential element of any risk management process. From now on, I will strive
							to systematically integrate both evaluation approaches and prioritize user involvement to
							improve the accuracy and effectiveness of my risk assessments.</p>
