						<p>Focus on various threat modeling methods and vulnerability management: it introduced popular
							approaches such as PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis), CVSS (Common
							Vulnerability Scoring System), ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common
							Knowledge), and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project). I also had the opportunity to
							deepen my understanding of STRIDE and Attack Trees, two methods I was already familiar with,
							by exploring their applications in more detail.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Difference between threats and vulnerabilities:</strong> It clarified
									the essential distinction between these two concepts. I learned that vulnerabilities
									are technical weaknesses in a system, whereas threats are events or circumstances
									that can exploit those vulnerabilities. This helped me better understand how both
									interact within a security framework.</li>
								<li><strong>Threat modeling techniques:</strong> While I was already familiar with
									STRIDE and Attack Trees, it allowed me to explore their application
									frameworks and utility in specific contexts. I also discovered tools like PASTA,
									which offers a more comprehensive, risk-oriented approach, as well as CVSS, a
									standardized system for scoring vulnerabilities. Additionally, ATT&CK and OWASP
									complemented this exploration by providing relevant frameworks for analyzing attacks
									and securing web applications.</li>
								<li><strong>Practical guides for threat modeling:</strong> Through resources like the
									Threat Modeling Manifesto and Adam Shostackâ€™s book, I gained practical knowledge on
									how to select and adapt these various threat modeling techniques depending on the
									specific needs of a security project.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Deepening my knowledge of threat modeling techniques:</strong> While I was
									already familiar with STRIDE and Attack Trees, it helped me better understand
									how and when to apply them in various contexts. For instance, STRIDE is particularly
									useful in complex software systems, whereas Attack Trees are effective in modeling
									attack scenarios in complex infrastructures.</li>
								<li><strong>Discovering new techniques:</strong> PASTA, CVSS, ATT&CK, and OWASP were key
									discoveries. I learned how these methods and frameworks can be used to analyze risks
									in a more structured and comprehensive manner. For example, PASTA allows for
									risk-based evaluation in complex environments, while CVSS provides a standardized
									framework for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities.</li>
								<li><strong>Combining techniques in a hybrid model:</strong> I also learned that
									combining multiple methods often leads to a more comprehensive analysis. For
									instance, PASTA can be combined with STRIDE or ATT&CK to provide a more complete
									evaluation of threats in dynamic environments.</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It allowed me to deepen my understanding of techniques I was already familiar with,
							such as STRIDE and Attack Trees, while introducing me to new tools like PASTA, CVSS, ATT&CK,
							and OWASP. What I found particularly interesting was how these different approaches
							complement each other and can be adapted depending on the context.</p>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>However, I also realized that mastering these tools requires a deep understanding of the
							system in which they are applied. The challenge lies in selecting the most appropriate
							method for each situation. For example, while STRIDE is powerful, it can be time-consuming
							to implement in very complex environments. I also learned that using these tools in the
							early stages of development is crucial to avoid costly corrections later in the process.</p>
