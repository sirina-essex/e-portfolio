						<h1>Applying Threat Modeling and Management Techniques</h1>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Focus on the practical application of threat modeling and management techniques, relying on
							essential resources like the Threat Modeling Manifesto, the OWASP Cookbook, and the MITRE
							ATT&CK database. The objective was to apply the methods previously studied and create threat
							models for real-world scenarios.</p>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Tools and resources for threat modeling:</strong> It allowed me to
									explore key resources like the Threat Modeling Manifesto, which advocates for a
									collaborative approach, and the MITRE ATT&CK database, which catalogs concrete
									techniques used by attackers. I learned how these resources provide tools for
									modeling threats in various contexts.</li>
								<li><strong>Using publicly available tools for threat modeling:</strong> We evaluated
									the effectiveness of several tools, such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees, as well
									as threat libraries, to identify and mitigate risks across different systems. These
									tools help structure threat analysis and adapt mitigation strategies accordingly.
								</li>
								<li><strong>Creating threat models for real-world scenarios:</strong> The unit
									emphasized the application of these techniques to scenarios like securing an airport
									or a nuclear power plant. This gave me a deeper understanding of how to apply these
									methods in real and complex environments.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Knowledge of key tools and resources:</strong> At the end, I
									gained an in-depth knowledge of critical resources like the Threat Modeling
									Manifesto, the OWASP Cookbook, and the MITRE ATT&CK database, which provide
									libraries, tools, and techniques for identifying and modeling threats.</li>
								<li><strong>Selecting the appropriate tool for various situations:</strong> I learned
									how to evaluate tools based on the scenario. For example, STRIDE is useful for
									complex systems, while DREAD helps rank threats based on their severity. It
									helped me understand when and how to use these tools effectively.</li>
								<li><strong>Critical evaluation of tool effectiveness:</strong> I was also able to
									assess the flexibility and structure of these tools in different contexts. While
									STRIDE is efficient for structuring threats, it can lack flexibility in dynamic
									environments, whereas Attack Trees are particularly effective for visualizing
									complex attack scenarios.</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It allowed me to put into practice the concepts studied earlier, which was
							particularly rewarding. Modeling threats for real-world scenarios, such as an international
							airport or a nuclear power plant, gave me a better perspective on the applicability of
							different techniques.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>I felt a sense of satisfaction in applying these tools, as it confirmed the importance of
							adapting the modeling method to the contextâ€™s specifics. However, selecting the most
							appropriate tool remains a challenge, especially in complex scenarios where threats are
							numerous and varied. It enhanced my understanding of the available tools and how to
							strategically use them for threat identification and mitigation.</p>
