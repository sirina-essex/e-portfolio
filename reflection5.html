						<h1>Security and Risk Management Standards</h1>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Focus on security and risk management standards used across various industries
							and organizations. It emphasized the importance of these standards in risk evaluation and
							security design processes. Understanding how these standards influence risk management and
							security is crucial for modern organizations.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Exploration of industry-specific standards:</strong> It allowed me to
									explore several regulatory frameworks, such as ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, and PCI
									DSS. I also examined industry-specific standards like ISO 27799 for healthcare and
									COBIT for financial institutions. These frameworks provide clear guidelines for
									securing information systems in different contexts.</li>
								<li><strong>Impact of standards on risk and security management:</strong> I examined how
									standards influence risk management by aligning security practices with
									organizational goals. For instance, ISO 31000 helps integrate risk management into
									strategic processes while ensuring better regulatory compliance.</li>
								<li><strong>Review of common business standards:</strong> I gained a deeper
									understanding of the importance of frameworks like ISO 27001 for information
									security, NIST CSF for critical infrastructure cybersecurity, and the GDPR for
									personal data protection. These standards help businesses follow best practices in
									risk and security management, especially when handling sensitive data.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Knowledge of common security standards:</strong> At the end, I
									gained a solid understanding of key security standards such as ISO 27001, ISO 31000,
									and PCI DSS. I learned how to identify the most appropriate standard for a given
									situation. For example, PCI DSS is essential for businesses handling credit card
									data, while ISO 27001 can be applied across various contexts to ensure information
									security.</li>
								<li><strong>Integrating standards into threat models:</strong> I understood that
									standards directly influence how threats are modeled. For example, NIST SP 800-53
									and ISO 27001 provide specific guidelines for securing information systems and
									mitigating threats in different environments.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It helped me better understand how security standards are applied in various
							industries. I found it particularly interesting to analyze how these standards vary from one
							sector to another and how each organization must adapt its approach based on the specific
							risks it faces.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>However, integrating these standards into existing processes can be challenging due to their
							complexity. I realized that each business, whether a bank or a hospital, must choose
							specific frameworks based on its priorities and industry requirements.</p>
