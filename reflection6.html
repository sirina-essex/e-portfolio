						<h1>Practical Implications of Standards</h1>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Focus on the practical application of security and risk management standards, especially
							those related to the GDPR and other sector-specific standards. We analyzed several case
							studies and explored the implications of these standards for various industries, including
							financial sectors and personal data management.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Case studies related to the GDPR:</strong> It allowed me to examine
									how various organizations respond to the strict requirements of the GDPR concerning
									personal data protection. I saw how these regulations influence risk management
									practices, especially regarding the need for explicit user consent and data breach
									notifications.</li>
								<li><strong>Exploring standards and framework websites:</strong> I explored websites
									such as ISO.org and NIST, which provide security frameworks and standards for
									different sectors. This helped me understand how to access reliable resources and
									select best practices tailored to specific cybersecurity needs.</li>
								<li><strong>Sector-specific standards and case studies:</strong> Through case studies
									across various sectors, I observed how companies adopt standards like ISO 27001 or
									PCI DSS to meet security requirements while minimizing the financial impact of
									compliance. This helped me grasp the financial and operational challenges of
									adopting these standards.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Explaining GDPR regulations in specific situations:</strong> It
									helped clarify the obligations imposed by the GDPR, such as personal data
									management, user consent, and breach notifications. These aspects are especially
									crucial for businesses operating in the EU or handling the data of EU citizens.</li>
								<li><strong>Knowledge of other applicable standards:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, I
									learned to assess the specific security needs of different companies. For example,
									PCI DSS is essential for businesses handling payment information, while frameworks
									like NIST SP 800-53 are more suitable for critical infrastructure.</li>
								<li><strong>Recommending measures to comply with standards:</strong> I understood the
									importance of adopting effective strategies to ensure compliance with standards, and
									I studied best practices for their implementation. For instance, regarding GDPR
									compliance, I learned that actions such as conducting regular audits, training
									employees on best data management practices, and ensuring a quick response to
									security breaches are essential.</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It clarified the practical implications of security standards, especially the GDPR,
							and their impact on various industries. I found it insightful to see how these standards
							affect not only businesses but also individuals. This also led me to reflect on the
							complexities companies face in maintaining compliance while staying agile and innovative.
						</p>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>Although these standards can impose a heavy administrative burden, they are essential for
							protecting users' rights in an increasingly digital world.</p>
