					<blockquote>
						<p>Coverage of various methods of quantitative risk modeling (QRM), focusing on probabilistic
							approaches such as Monte Carlo simulations, Bayes' theorem, and multi-criteria analysis
							techniques such as TOPSIS, AHP, and ANP. These tools allow for the quantification of risks
							in complex and uncertain scenarios, providing more accurate risk analysis compared to
							qualitative approaches.</p>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Quantitative Risk Modeling (QRM):</strong> Unlike qualitative approaches
									that rely on subjective risk matrices, QRM uses statistical and probabilistic
									methods to provide more precise data. This enables better anticipation of potential
									impacts and probabilities in project risk management.</li>
								<li><strong>QRM Approaches:</strong> I explored several commonly used methods, including
									Monte Carlo simulations, which model scenarios considering uncertainty, and Bayes'
									theorem, which updates probabilities as new information becomes available.
									Multi-criteria techniques like AHP and ANP also help prioritize and evaluate
									different alternatives based on various criteria.</li>
								<li><strong>Strengths and limitations of approaches:</strong> We analyzed the strengths
									and weaknesses of each method. For instance, while Monte Carlo is highly effective
									for simulating outcomes in uncertain scenarios, selecting the right probability
									distributions is crucial. Similarly, AHP can become inconsistent when too many
									criteria are considered.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Using quantitative risk modeling techniques:</strong> I learned how to apply
									methods like Monte Carlo simulations to model risks in complex projects. These
									simulations provide probabilistic forecasts of potential outcomes based on various
									assumptions.</li>
								<li><strong>Selecting the appropriate technique:</strong> Each method has its strengths
									and weaknesses. For example, Monte Carlo is particularly effective in
									high-uncertainty situations, while AHP is more useful for decisions involving
									multiple criteria. Bayes' theorem is ideal for situations where new information
									allows revising initial estimates.</li>
								<li><strong>Critical evaluation of methods:</strong> The unit emphasized the importance
									of evaluating each method based on its application context. For instance, AHP may be
									ineffective for overly complex systems, while Monte Carlo depends heavily on the
									quality of tools and algorithms used.</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It provided an enriching perspective on advanced techniques for quantifying risks,
							which is often more precise than traditional qualitative methods. I especially appreciated
							the power of Monte Carlo simulations for providing a probabilistic overview of risky
							scenarios. However, I also became aware of the limitations of certain techniques, such as
							AHP, which can become inconsistent with too many criteria.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>I realized that these methods, while powerful, require reliable data and well-founded
							assumptions to be effective.</p>
