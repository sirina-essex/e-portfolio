						<h1>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</h1>
					</header>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I explored the essential concepts of Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR),
							critical tools for risk management and organizational resilience. It focused on the creation
							and management of BC/DR plans, key factors such as BIA, RTO, and RPO, as well as emerging
							trends in information risk management.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Two Columns for What I Learned and Learning Outcomes -->
					<div class="columns">
						<!-- Left Column: What I Learned -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Creating Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) Plans:</strong>
									ISO 22301 was highlighted as a key standard in creating BC plans, ensuring that a
									business can maintain critical functions in the event of major incidents.</li>
								<li><strong>Key Factors in BC/DR Plans:</strong> Concepts like RTO and RPO help assess
									recovery needs. For instance, RTO measures the time needed to restore critical
									functions, while RPO defines the maximum allowable data loss.</li>
								<li><strong>Emerging Trends in Information Risk Management:</strong> Cloud solutions and
									DRaaS have become vital, providing cost-effective recovery solutions that ensure
									fast recovery in case of major disasters.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- Right Column: Learning Outcomes -->
						<div class="column">
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Understanding BC, DR, RTO, and RPO:</strong> I deepened my understanding of
									how these concepts interact, like how RTO/RPO requirements determine the recovery
									strategy and solutions like DRaaS.</li>
								<li><strong>Proposing suitable recovery solutions:</strong> Based on specific business
									needs, I can now suggest solutions like DRaaS for SMEs looking for reliable yet
									cost-efficient recovery strategies.</li>
								<li><strong>Analyzing future trends in risk management:</strong> The growing relevance
									of digital transformation and cloud solutions has pushed businesses to adapt their
									BC/DR plans continuously.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>Critical and Personal Reflections</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>ISO 22301 provided a structured framework for developing BC/DR plans, and the relevance of
							disaster recovery in today's digital context became evident. However, solutions like DRaaS
							showed me that while effective, they can be complex to implement and require careful
							cost-benefit analysis.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<!-- Box for Final Reflections -->
					<div class="box">
						<p>Understanding how BC and DR fit into an organizationâ€™s overall strategy is key for building
							resilience, especially in light of digital transformation and cloud-based solutions.</p>
